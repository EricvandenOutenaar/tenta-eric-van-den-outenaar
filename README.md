**Reading guide.**

In the following document you will first find some installing instructions. After that you can read my conclusions concerning the different technologies that we discusses in our course for making dynamic websites. That part will be in Swedish.

**Clone the Github repo and install the Gatsby site.**

    Go via your command line to your project folder where you want to install this project.

    Write:

    Gatsby new [give the folder a name!] https://github.com/EricvandenOutenaar/tenta-eric-van-den-outenaar.git && cd [the name of that folder] && code .

    This will clone my repo into your folderm install this gatsby project and open up visual studio code. If you don't use Visual Studio forget the code . part of the commando and just open the project via your code editor.

    Once your code editor opens, run Gatsby develop to start the development server and show to site on your local host port in your browser. If you for what reason would encounter problems. Please run a gatsby clean followed by an npm install from the terminal to make sure all the packages from the JSON files are correctly installed.
